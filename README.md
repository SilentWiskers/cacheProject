Our cache program is written in Java

Our cache.java file can be RUN as follows: java cache < input file.txt >. 
Our file takes in an input file, sorts out the cache with the number of 	
sets, set size, and line size and then iteratively reads each read/write
with the address and checks the cache. 
Functions are used to print to the terminal and calculate the final
statistics.
